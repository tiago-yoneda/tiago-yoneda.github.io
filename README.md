# Personal github page

<https://tiago-yoneda.github.io/>

Personal page created at the beggining of our course at Trybe - <https://betrybe.com/>, using simple HTML and CSS.

So far it only hosts a simple intro page, a list of my projects at Trybe and a list of certificates.

I do plan on making a new github page using react componnets and a CSS framework.
